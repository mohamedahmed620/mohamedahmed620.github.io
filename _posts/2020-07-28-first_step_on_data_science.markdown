     My passion for programming started when I was 7 years old. I started learning how to program LOGO language through my primary school. My school decided to cancel the LOGO programming class since it’s an old obsolete language but the passion for programming didn’t go away. 

     I earned my bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering so I can pursue my dream of developing software programs for medical devices. I had the opportunity to move to the US. I changed my career path as I got more interested in owning a private business and enjoying taking the risk and gaining the profits. I always used my programming skills on creating a fully developed program using VBA and Excel platforms to calculate my business finances and predict how to improve future sales.

     Everything in my life was going great until the coronavirus hit the USA. I had to close my business in SF. It was a good chance for me to rethink again about my passion for studying and programming. I started a Bootcamp to become a web developer. I found myself drifting away from building a program and focusing more on designing a user interface mostly with CSS language and how to design a UI and some coloring skills needed which I felt its fun, but that’s not the career I want to pursue. The conclusion from my first Bootcamp experience, I found myself enjoying Java scripting but not a big fan of UI design. 

     I searched to learn more about data science. I felt that’s the discipline I am looking for and that’s the career I want to pursue. Data science can be used as a way to refine random data to illustrate conclusions and results. It also can be useful in building algorithm and machine learning techniques to help predict an incident or occurrence of a biomarker for a particular disease indication. It’s a sufficient tool that refines data from the past and the present and offers solutions for our problems and unknown.

     I read many articles on how data scientists worked on demonstrating the prediction of the Covid19 infectious population number based on people’s daily actions and the percussion manners. 
  
     I wish I had the sufficient skills needed to build a data model for my own business and address my problems to be solved. Now, after reading and learning more about data science, I imagine how it is useful for solving problems especially problems I faced through my own business and how it would help me better understand my customer needs. I thought of many ideas on how to measure the most desirable items for customers on my menu and how to increase my sale accordingly and improve my business. I could also predict which items the customers usually like to buy together, or what time that needed more workers in the kitchen based on historical data.

     Every day I gain more knowledge of data science and how to implement statistical analysis and algorithms to solve problems, I wish I learned all in the early stage of my life. Going through our classes, I am more and more convinced that our world looking for more data scientists. I am so excited to study more about data science and use the tools to build new models and predict new facts and help humanity.
